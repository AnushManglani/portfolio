In this tutorial, I would be talking about how to build your object detection algorithm from scratch, which will work on satellite imagery. For this, I would like you to have a little knowledge about Deep Learning, Python, and some terminal commands, that’s all you require. We’ll be using YOLO, an accurate and fast deep learning algorithm for object detection given by Joseph Redmon et al. And with their latest version YOLOv3, the accuracy has been further enhanced. So here we go.
